# planutils

General library for setting up linux-based environments for developing, running, and evaluating planners.


## 1. Running the latest Docker release

The released Docker image comes with the latest planutils pre-installed. Note that in order to
run a number of the planners (all those that are based on singularity), you will need
to run the docker with the `--privileged` option.

**Run the planutils container**
```
docker run -it --privileged aiplanning/planutils:latest bash
```

**Active the planutils environment**
```
planutils activate
```

This means that in order to run the latest release, it is not necessary to clone this repository.

## 2. Making your own image with desired solvers

Below is an example for creating your own Dockerfile based on the latest release, with pre-installed solvers
```
FROM aiplanning/planutils:latest

# Install solvers and tools
RUN yes | planutils install val
RUN yes | planutils install planning.domains
RUN yes | planutils install popf
RUN yes | planutils install optic
RUN yes | planutils install smtplan
```

## 3. Running planutils from source
You can also run the latest unreleased version. For this, clone this repository and run 
```
docker build . -t planutils-dev:latest
```

## 4. Usage

### Example of currently working functionality

```bash
$ lama domain.pddl problem.pddl

### Example of upcoming functionality

```bash

## 5. Add a new package
### Package Configuration
1. Create a folder for new pacakeg, the package name will be the used to call the planner later
2. Set up the `install`, `run`,  `uninstall`, and manifest file. You can find the template files under packages/TEMPLATE folder

### Write Manifest file

Please create a manifest file named `manifest_compact.json` if you want to use predefined templates in the packages/TEMPLATE/SERVICE_TEMPLATE folder. The full `manifest.json` will be generated at the run time. You can overwrite the dafult template by restating the value of json fields. 

You can also create a `manifest.json` file directly if you don't need the template.

**Manifest Example**
```
{
    "name": "LAMA-FIRST",
    "description": "http://fast-downward.org/",
    "install-size": "20K",
    "dependencies": [
        "downward"
    ],
    "endpoint": {
        "services": {
            "solve": {
                "args": [
                    {
                        "name": "domain",
                        "type": "file",
                        "description": "domain file"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "problem",
                        "type": "file",
                        "description": "problem file"
                    }
                ],
                "call": "lama-first {domain} {problem}",
                "return": {
                    "type": "generic",
                    "files": "*plan*"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
**Define Args**

There are four types of Args: `file`, `int`, `string` and,`categorical`. You can add default value for `int`,`string`, and `categorical` arguments

```
 "args": [
    {
        "name": "domain",
        "type": "file",
        "description": "domain file"
    },
    {
        "name": "number_of_plans",
        "type": "int",
        "description": "Number of Plans",
        "default":3
    },
    {
        "name": "custom_search_algorithm",
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Custom Search Algorithm",
        "default":"kstar(blind(),k=1)"
    },
    {
        "name": "search_algorithm",
        "type": "categorical",
        "description": "Search Algorithm",
        "choices":[
          {
            "display_value":"Kstar Blind k=1",
            "value":"kstar(blind(),k=1)"
          },
          {
            "display_value":"Kstar Blind k=2",
            "value":"kstar(blind(),k=2)"
          }
        ],
        "default":"kstar(blind(),k=1)"
    }
]
```
**Define Return Types**

There are three types of return data: `generic`, `json` and `log`. The `generic` type should be used for all the text based result, the `log` type should be used for planner like Optic and Tfd which didn't generate a proper plan, and the type `json` should used for plan in JSON format.

For the value of `files`, you will have to write a [glob](https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html) pattern. Planning-as-service backend uses `glob` libary to find and return all the files that matched. 
```
"return": {
                    "type": "generic/log/json",
                    "files": "*plan*"
                }
```
